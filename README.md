Overview

This project implements the RSA public-key encryption algorithm in C, using fundamental data structures such as stacks and linked lists.
The RSA algorithm allows secure communication by encrypting messages with a public key and decrypting them with a private key.

Features:
  Generate public and private keys based on prime numbers.
  Encrypt and decrypt messages .
  Store messages using linked lists and keys using stacks.
  Command-line interface for inputting number of lines and keys.

Algorithm: RSA key generation, encryption, and decryption.

Learning Outcomes
  Understanding public-key cryptography principles.
  Implementing modular arithmetic using custom data structures.
  Practicing C programming and dynamic memory management.
  Reinforcing the use of stacks and linked lists in real-world applications.
